Strategies that exclusively use active investments may potentially be more expensive, tax inefficient, and more volatile than index-oriented strategies. On the other hand, an all-index approach may forgo the potential return enhancement provided by active managers in certain asset classes, while also diluting the impact of diversifying investments in asset classes that aren't effectively represented by an index. Therefore some investment professionals believe that combining active and passive strategies provides a better risk-return profile than exclusively using one or the other.

These securities are required to be kept segregated from E*TRADE Securities' own assets, and cannot be used by E*TRADE Securities to satisfy its own obligations.</p>\n\n\n<p><b>SIPC Protection</b><br/>\nIn addition, E*TRADE Securities LLC is a Member of <a></a><a href=\"http://www.sipc.org/\">SIPC</a>, which protects securities of its members up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for claims for cash). SIPC's explanatory brochure is available upon request or at <a></a><a href=\"http://www.sipc.org/\">www.sipc.org</a>.</p>\n\n<p>SIPC coverage is not the same as the insurance on bank accounts provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). It does not protect investors against a decline in the market value of securities. SIPC generally protects customers against the physical loss of securities if the broker-dealer holding the securities for the customer fails.</p>\n\n<p><b>Additional Brokerage Protection</b><br/>\nE*TRADE Clearing LLC has purchased from London insurers additional protection with an aggregate limit of $600 million to pay amounts in addition to those returned in a SIPC liquidation, provided that (1) the combined return from the trustee distributions, SIPC, and London to any customer does not exceed $150 million, and (2) as a sub-limit, return of cash to any customer by London does not exceed $900,000. This coverage does not protect against loss of the market value of securities.

Although ETFs are designed to provide investment results that generally correspond to the performance of their respective underlying indices, they may not be able to exactly replicate the performance of the indices because of expenses and other factors. Also, there are brokerage commissions associated with trading ETFs that may negate their low management fees. ETFs are required to distribute portfolio gains to shareholders at year end.

When trading on margin, an investor borrows a portion of the funds he/she uses to buy stocks to try to take advantage of opportunities in the market.  He/she pays interest on the funds borrowed until the loan is repaid. For each trade made in a margin account, we use all available cash and sweep funds first and then charge the customer the current margin interest rate on the balance of the funds required to fill the order.

Once you're a customer, you can log on and visit the Bond Resource Center to learn more.\n\n What is Adaptive Portfolio?\n\nAdaptive Portfolio is a professionally managed advisory program from E*TRADE Capital Management that can help keep investors on track with their financial goals. It assesses investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon to identify an appropriate asset allocation for each investor. Adaptive Portfolio enables investors to choose between a portfolio of either exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or a hybrid portfolio of both ETFs and mutual funds. The standard minimum account balance to enroll in Adaptive Portfolio is $10,000. The minimum account balance for Traditional and Roth Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) is $5,000. The portfolio rebalances as necessary and we provide access to a dedicated support team of investment adviser representatives that investors can speak with whenever they have a question.\n\n How does it work?\n\nFirst, answer a series of questions about investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Based on those answers, a portfolio is created for an investor. The portfolio will contain a diversified allocation of either ETFs or a combination of both ETFs and mutual funds—whichever is preferred. Then the investor can enroll an eligible new or existing E*TRADE Securities brokerage account with just a few clicks. Unlike many auto-investing solutions, Adaptive Portfolio combines human touch with responsive technology. If an Adaptive Portfolio account shifts too far from a target asset allocation, it automatically rebalances when necessary to help keep the portfolio on track. \n\n Why should I have E*TRADE Capital Management manage my investments?\n\nE*TRADE Capital Management follows a disciplined investment strategy based on principles of modern financial theory. The portfolio will be rebalanced if market conditions materially change the portfolio’s asset allocation. All portfolio holdings will be selected by E*TRADE Capital Management’s Investment Strategy Team based on multi-stage due diligence. \n\nHere’s how the investments are managed: \n\nE*TRADE Capital Management’s Investment Policy Committee, with the support of the Investment Strategy Team, develops model portfolios. \nThe team utilizes an investment analysis methodology that incorporates various quantitative criteria, including historical return, risk, expenses, manager tenure, performance and style consistency, and asset size and growth, to select securities held in the investment portfolios.\nE*TRADE Capital Management then selects a diversified mix of ETFs or a hybrid portfolio of ETFs and mutual funds for the portfolio. The goal is to select the right non-proprietary investments based on an investor’s investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.\nIf the asset allocation starts to shift beyond established parameters, Adaptive Portfolio rebalances the portfolio as necessary to help keep the account on track.\nAccess to an investment adviser representative is just a phone call away.\n\nFor additional information, please see the E*TRADE Wrap-Fee Programs Brochure.\n\nUnlike many robo advisors, we offer a choice between a portfolio of securities with all ETFs, and a portfolio with a distinct, hybrid approach that combines ETFs and mutual funds. \n\nA hybrid approach may be beneficial as it uses low-cost ETFs to provide exposure to asset classes where passive investing makes sense, but then adds mutual funds in areas where an active management approach may add value. Strategies that exclusively use active investments may potentially be more expensive, tax inefficient, and more volatile than index-oriented strategies. On the other hand, an all-index approach may forgo the potential return enhancement provided by active managers in certain asset classes, while also diluting the impact of diversifying investments in asset classes that aren't effectively represented by an index. Therefore some investment professionals believe that combining active and passive strategies provides a better risk-return profile than exclusively using one or the other. For more information on this topic, visit “What is the difference between an all ETF portfolio and a hybrid mutual fund and ETF portfolio?” in the FAQs below.\n\nAnd finally, we’ll send monthly market commentary, along with timely insights during major market events, to help keep clients informed about their investments and the market. \n\n What makes Adaptive Portfolio different from other auto-investing or robo solutions?\n\nUnlike many auto-investing solutions, we:\n\n1.      Let clients choose between a portfolio of ETFs, or a hybrid portfolio of both ETFs and mutual funds.\n\n2.      Give clients access to a dedicated support team of investment adviser representatives to answer any potential questions.\n\n3.      Do not offer our own proprietary ETFs or mutual funds. \n\n4.      Make sure our clients’ money works hard for them: We invest all of our clients’ money and put only about 1% in cash holdings.\n\n How does an investor get started?\n\nWhen we designed Adaptive Portfolio, we started with the premise that it should be as easy-to-use as possible. That’s why we boiled everything down to three simple steps:\n\nStep 1: Complete an Investor Profile Questionnaire\n\nWe’ll guide investors through a short series of questions about their investment goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. It’s the information we need to know to make an investment recommendation.\n\nStep 2: Review the Recommended Adaptive Portfolio\n\nNext, we’ll recommend a diversified portfolio that fits the selected Investor Profile. An investor will be able to choose between a portfolio with all ETFs or a hybrid portfolio of both ETFs and mutual funds.\n\nStep 3: Implement the Portfolio\n\nWith just a few clicks, an investor can put a plan into action with Adaptive Portfolio. We’ll monitor the portfolio on an ongoing basis and rebalance the holdings as necessary.\n\nAlso, clients can set up recurring transfers and benefit from the potential long-term advantages of dollar-cost averaging and the convenience of investing regularly without requiring any repeating actions.\n\nClick here to get started.\n\n How long does it take to complete the enrollment process?\n\nIt takes less than 15 minutes. Need help? Just give us a call at 1-866-484-3658. \n\n Is there a way to learn more about the enrollment process?\n\nOf course! We always love to speak with new and existing clients. Just call our investment adviser representative support team at 1-866-484-3658 weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. ET. Our Customer Service team can also live chat anytime, seven days a week.\n\n What happens after enrolling?\n\nAll the investments are typically made within three business days. Adaptive Portfolio accounts are monitored daily and rebalanced as necessary. Clients can check their holdings online 24/7 through the Complete View page, and we’ll send clients monthly market commentary, along with timely insights during major market events, to help keep clients informed about their investments.If you like our recommended Adaptive Portfolio (and have met the $10,000 minimum), we can start building it with just a few clicks. All the investments are typically made within three business days. Your Adaptive Portfolio will be monitored daily and rebalanced as necessary. You can check your holdings online 24/7 through the Complete View page, and we’ll send you monthly market commentary, along with timely insights during major market events, to help keep you informed about your investments.\n\n How does E*TRADE Capital Management keep their clients’ interests in mind?\n\nWe build and manage an Adaptive Portfolio based on a client’s stated investment goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. The Investor Profile Questionnaire we use may be more comprehensive than other digital investment solutions. It was diligently developed and tested to help match clients to their investor profile. Our risk-based allocations consider modern portfolio theory for each investor profile. We also have a mere 1% target cash allocation in all our portfolios. Finally, we provide access to a team of investment adviser representatives that clients can speak to when they have a question. \n\n What criteria does E*TRADE Capital Management use to pick investments for a portfolio?\n\nFor each asset class (such as equities or fixed income), E*TRADE Capital Management selects investment holdings that, when combined in broad-based asset allocation strategies, seek to provide a high-level of return potential for a given level of risk over the long-term, generally three years or longer. That’s called risk-adjusted return potential.\n\nEach investment selection is made by analyzing a spectrum of key data points, such as historical performance, expenses, tracking error, and liquidity. E*TRADE Capital Management reviews and evaluates the investment holdings in a portfolio on an ongoing basis and automatically rebalances the account as necessary.\n\n Can a client select a different portfolio than the one recommended?\n\nWe recommend a portfolio based on the investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon a client specifies in the Investor Profile Questionnaire. If a client’s financial situation or goals change, he or she will have the opportunity to view other portfolios and retake the questionnaire to update his or her financial situation. We can also help clients complete the Investor Profile Questionnaire. For assistance, call our dedicated support team at 1-866-484-3658, weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. ET.We recommend your portfolio based on your risk tolerance and time horizon that you specified in the Investor Profile Questionnaire. If your financial situation or goals change, you will have the opportunity to view other portfolios and retake the questionnaire to further clarify your financial situation. We can also help you complete the Investor Profile. For assistance, call our dedicated support team at 1-866-484-3658, weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. ET.\n\n How do the risk questions within the Investor Profile Questionnaire help E*TRADE Capital Management determine an Investor Profile?\n\nThe trade-off between risk and reward is what drives investing and so we identify an investor profile based on the responses to a number of different investment scenarios. These responses help E*TRADE Capital Management gauge a client’s willingness and ability to ride out short-term ups and downs in pursuit of potentially higher long-term returns. Please note that answers selected within the Investor Profile Questionnaire are not equally weighted when determining a recommended portfolio. The tradeoff between risk and reward is what drives investing so we identify your investor profile based on your response to a number of different investment scenarios. Your responses help E*TRADE Capital Management gauge your willingness and ability to ride out short-term ups and downs in pursuit of potentially higher long-term returns. Please note that answers selected within the Investor Profile Questionnaire are not equally weighted in determining your recommended portfolio. \n\n Why are there nine questions in the Investor Profile Questionnaire?\n\nWe take our responsibility of providing a recommended portfolio very seriously so we created a comprehensive Investor Profile Questionnaire. An investor’s time horizon, risk tolerance, and investment goals are factored into a recommendation.\n\nWhen navigating through the Investor Profile Questionnaire, before selecting an answer, click on the question mark icons at the bottom of each screen to learn more about why we ask each question. \n\n Is Adaptive Portfolio available for Traditional and Roth IRAs?\n\nYes. There are two choices available for Adaptive Portfolio based on the balance of your account:\n\n1.      Traditional and Roth IRA accounts can enroll with a minimum account balance of $5,000 and will consist of a hybrid portfolio of mutual funds and ETFs.\n\n2.      Standard portfolios consist of all ETFs or a hybrid portfolio of ETFs and mutual funds and clients can choose which they prefer. The minimum account balance for these portfolios is $10,000.\n\nBoth of these portfolios are allocated with the intention of being diversified for long-term investing and are managed accordingly.\n\n What is the difference between an all-ETF portfolio and a hybrid mutual fund and ETF portfolio?\n\n• All- ETF Portfolio\nThese portfolios are comprised of ETFs. ETFs are baskets of stocks or other securities designed to track a market, industry, or trading strategy. This means an index ETF attempts to match, not outperform, the market. ETFs are typically not actively managed, so they tend to have lower internal operating costs than traditional mutual funds. The bottom line: An all-ETF portfolio may offer an efficient way to achieve broad diversification at a lower cost.\n\n• A hybrid portfolio of ETFs and mutual funds\nThese portfolios are comprised of  low-cost ETFs to provide exposure to asset classes where passive indexing makes sense, and adds mutual funds in areas where an active management approach may add value. We call these our “hybrid portfolios.” Active mutual fund managers’ ability to seek out opportunities for higher returns or reduced risk may help offset their added operating expense, particularly in certain equity styles and fixed income categories. In addition, we also offer tax-sensitive hybrid portfolios for each Investor Profile. This can help minimize the taxes of a portfolio in a taxable account.• All Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)\nThese portfolios are comprised of ETFs. ETFs are baskets of stocks or other securities designed to track a market, an industry or trading strategy, This means anindex ETF attempts to match, not outperform, the market. ETFs are typically not actively managed, so they tend to have lower internal operating costs than traditional mutual funds. The bottom line: an all-ETF portfolio may offer an efficient way to achieve broad diversification at a lower cost.\n\n How are ETFs different from mutual funds?\n\nManagement:\n\nMost ETFs are passively managed by tracking the composition and performance of a market, industry, or trading strategy. On the other hand, most mutual funds are actively managed by portfolio managers. Active management seeks opportunities for higher returns, although there is no guarantee for achieving this.\n\nOperating expense:\n\nBecause mutual funds are actively managed, they tend to have higher internal operating expenses than ETFs; however, active mutual fund managers can seek out opportunities for higher returns or reduced risk, which may help offset the added expense. Underlying fund expenses are taken into account during the portfolio selection process. Also, when possible, we seek to utilize the institutional share class of mutual funds, which means they are typically less expensive than the average retail share class of the fund.\n\nPrice:\n\nThe price of a mutual fund is set at the end of each trading day. ETFs, on the other hand, trade on the open market. This means that the price of ETFs trading in the secondary market fluctuates throughout the day, influenced by investor demand and seller supply.\n\n What are contributory Adaptive Portfolios?\n\nA contributory Adaptive Portfolio is a portfolio designed specifically for Traditional and Roth IRAs that have a maximum annual contribution defined by the IRS. These portfolios have a lower initial investment minimum of $5,000 to allow for clients to enroll an account within the allowable contribution limit.\n\nThe portfolios are similar to the standard Adaptive Portfolio investment in that they are diversified, focused on long-term growth, and customized based on risk tolerance. These are hybrid portfolios that include both mutual funds and ETFs.\n\nOnce a contributory Adaptive Portfolio account value reaches $10,000, the account will be aligned with a standard Adaptive Portfolio allocation. This means that based on investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon, a client may stay in a hybrid portfolio or transition to an all-ETF portfolio. \n\n What types of accounts are eligible for Adaptive Portfolio?\n\nMost retail E*TRADE Securities brokerage and IRA accounts with a U.S. address can enroll in the Adaptive Portfolio program. If an investor has one of the following, they are good to go.\n\nIndividual account\nJoint account\nTraditional and Roth IRA\nIRA for Minors\nBeneficiary IRA\nIndividual 401(k)\nRoth Individual 401(k)\nRollover IRA\nCustodial account\n\n When can clients expect their money to be invested?\n\nOnce a client meets the investment minimum, he or she can expect to see the initial portfolio holdings purchased within three business days of accepting the Advisory Agreement. Additional deposits into the Adaptive Portfolio account are also invested within three business days.\n\n Can a client set up a recurring deposit?\n\nYes, that’s a really good idea to help stay disciplined with saving and investing. Clients can use the online Transfer Money service to set up recurring deposits into their account based on the amount and schedule that works for them. Deposits will be invested automatically into their Adaptive Portfolio accounts and can help build assets without ever lifting a finger.Yes, that’s actually a really prudent idea. You can use our online Transfer Money service to set up recurring deposits into your account based on the amount and schedule that works for you. They will be invested automatically into your Adaptive Portfolio, and you can help build your assets without ever lifting a finger.\n\n Does Adaptive Portfolio offer cash management features, such as free checking?\n\nAdaptive Portfolio is managed with a long-term perspective in mind. Frequent cash withdrawals might make the portfolio hard to manage and cause it to deviate from its objectives. To avoid this problem, Adaptive Portfolio doesn’t offer features such as check writing, debit cards, and bill pay. However, we don’t want to stand between clients and their cash. If a client needs to make a withdrawal, Customer Service can be reached anytime at 1-866-484-3658, and we’ll send a check or wire. A client can also transfer money online to another account and withdraw it from there.Adaptive Portfolio is managed with a long-term perspective in mind.

You can also transfer money online to another account and withdraw if from there.\n\n Can a client convert an existing E*TRADE Securities brokerage account to Adaptive Portfolio?\n\nYes. A client can enroll any eligible brokerage or retirement account in the Adaptive Portfolio advisory program, including a(n):\n\nIndividual account\nJoint account\n\nTraditional and Roth IRA \nIRA for Minors\nBeneficiary IRA\nIndividual 401(k)\nRoth Individual 401(k)\n\nRollover IRA\nCustodial accounts\n\nThe full value of the account selected will be converted when the client completes the enrollment process. If the client wants to convert only a portion of the account, a new Adaptive Portfolio account can be opened. They can then easily transfer a portion of an existing account into the new Adaptive Portfolio account.\n\n Does a client need to sell any securities before he or she can enroll an account in Adaptive Portfolio?\n\nNo, we’ll do that for our clients. If Adaptive Portfolio determines that certain securities aren’t in a client’s recommended portfolio, it will ask the client to agree to sell the selected securities as part of the enrollment process. Once the client agrees to liquidate these holdings, we will do it automatically once the conversion is complete. As an added benefit, the transactions will be commission-free.\n\nThe advisory fee and underlying fund expenses will apply. Note that the sale of the holdings may result in realized capital gains or losses.\n\n Can an account be funded by transferring securities from another brokerage account?\n\nYes, a lot of clients do that. More than likely, Adaptive Portfolio will have to sell the securities (commission-free, of course) before they can be allocated to the portfolio.\n\n Can self-directed trades be placed in an Adaptive Portfolio account?\n\nNo, Adaptive Portfolio is designed for investors who want ongoing help and a professional to manage their account. Please keep in mind, Adaptive Portfolio is a discretionary program and only E*TRADE Capital Management can place trades in an Adaptive Portfolio account. Of course, if investors would like to do some investing and trading on their own, they can open a regular E*TRADE Securities brokerage account at any time.\n\n How much cash is in my account?\n\nWe have a mere 1% target cash allocation in all portfolios. This target 1% allocation is invested in interest-bearing money market funds or cash alternatives, where we seek to ensure a portfolio is as efficient as possible.\n\n How does E*TRADE Capital Management choose which investments to sell when a client withdraws funds?\n\n \n\nWe would first try to use the cash balance in the account to satisfy the withdrawal. If the client needs additional cash, we strategically sell investments from across the portfolio in an effort to maintain the portfolio’s target asset allocation.\n\n If the value of the account falls below the initial investment minimum, will a client be removed from the program?\n\nNo, we will continue to manage a client’s account even if it falls below the initial investment minimum. If the balance remains under the initial investment minimum for an extended amount of time, a client may eventually be asked to add funds to bring the account back to Adaptive Portfolio’s initial minimum. That’s because anything less than the initial investment minimum makes it hard to maintain an adequately diversified Adaptive Portfolio. On a related note, please keep in mind that portfolio performance may be impacted if money is moved in and out of the account.\n\n How much does Adaptive Portfolio cost?\n\nThere is an annual net advisory fee of 0.30%.\n\nEach quarter, we calculate the annual net advisory fee based on the average daily market value of an account. For example, an account with an average daily balance of $50K for the quarter will be charged $37.50 for that quarter. This direct fee is charged at the beginning of each new quarter for services provided the previous quarter. It is automatically deducted from the account.\n\n Account Market Value  Maximum Annual Net Advisory Fee\n\n$5,000 and over 0.30%\n\n Does E*TRADE Capital Management help clients with tax reporting?\n\nWe provide resources like the E*TRADE Tax Center to help clients understand how their investments may be taxed. All taxable account activity will be reported on the annual IRS Form 1099, which is typically available in February of each year. We encourage clients to contact their tax advisor for any tax reporting questions.\n\n What tax-efficiency features are offered by Adaptive Portfolio?\n\nAdaptive Portfolio provides a tax-sensitive investment strategy within the hybrid offering that utilizes municipal bond mutual funds that may help reduce taxes incurred on interest and dividends associated with those portfolios. Due to the limited tax-sensitive products in the ETF universe, there are no tax-sensitive ETF portfolios at this time.\n\n How does Adaptive Portfolio rebalance an account?\n\nAdaptive Portfolio uses technology to monitor client accounts. If a portfolio shifts too far from a target asset allocation, E*TRADE Capital Management reviews the portfolio and the portfolio self-adjusts. In other words, it rebalances as necessary to help keep clients in line with their target allocation. It’s a technology-driven, disciplined approach that helps take the human emotion out of the equation.\n\nAdditionally, once a Contributory Adaptive Portfolio account value reaches $10,000, the portfolio holdings will be aligned with holdings in the standard Adaptive Portfolio account. This means that based on investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon, a client will have access to a hybrid portfolio of ETFs and mutual funds or transition to an all-ETF portfolio.\n\n How often can a client expect his or her portfolio to rebalance?\n\nE*TRADE Capital Management will rebalance an account when it shifts too far from a target asset allocation. Although we monitor the account daily, it does not mean we will trade in the account daily. There could be some periods of time where the allocation does not shift, and no trades are required.\n\nIn addition, E*TRADE Capital Management will also rebalance the account on a semi-annual basis to align the account with its target asset allocation. \n\n How do clients update their information if their financial situation changes?\n\nNothing ever stays the same. Adaptive Portfolio recognizes that if investment goals, risk tolerance, or time horizon has changed, clients should update their Investor Profile Questionnaire  by logging on to their account and retaking the questionnaire (Accounts > Portfolios > Performance and Value > Update the Adaptive Investor Profile). Based on the new responses, we may take another look at the asset allocation and recommend some changes to the portfolio.\n\n Can clients talk to a real person if they have questions?\n\nYes! Nothing makes us happier than speaking with clients (and potential clients). Just call our dedicated support team of investment adviser representatives at 1-866-484-3658, weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. ET. Live chat with a Customer Service representative is also available anytime, seven days a week.\n\n Are Financial Consultants assigned to Adaptive Portfolio accounts?\n\nWhile clients will not have a Financial Consultant specifically assigned to their Adaptive Portfolio account, they do have access to investment adviser representatives through our dedicated support team at 1-866-484-3658, weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. ET. Chat Live Now with a Customer Service representative anytime, seven days a week.\n\n Can E*TRADE stock plan assets be used to open an Adaptive Portfolio account?\n\nClients can open a new Adaptive Portfolio account and request to transfer vested unrestricted shares from their stock plan account into their Adaptive Portfolio account, subject to any limitations set forth in the account.\n\nPlease note: Shares held in an E*TRADE Securities stock plan account may be subject to certain sale and/or transfer restrictions and may be ineligible to be used to fund an account for the Adaptive Portfolio Program. Please consult a stock plan administrator regarding eligibility of certain holdings.\n\nNot seeing an answer to a question?

E*TRADE Securities offers some of the most competitive margin interest rates in the industry.

Typically these stocks — securities not specifically authorized to trade on the automated system offered by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) — are either lower-priced securities or ADRs (American Depository Receipts) and are thinly traded. As a result, buy orders for bulletin board stocks must be placed as limit orders.\n\nNote: E*TRADE Securities can't guarantee the accuracy of any quotation information on our site for these securities. You can usually place bulletin board trades on your own using our online system. However, sometimes the information you need may not be available for some thinly traded stocks.

SIPC's explanatory brochure is available upon request or at www.sipc.org.\n\nSIPC coverage is not the same as the insurance on bank accounts provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). It does not protect investors against a decline in the market value of securities. SIPC generally protects customers against the physical loss of securities if the broker-dealer holding the securities for the customer fails.\n\nAdditional Brokerage Protection\nE*TRADE Clearing LLC has purchased from London insurers additional protection with an aggregate limit of $600 million to pay amounts in addition to those returned in a SIPC liquidation, provided that (1) the combined return from the trustee distributions, SIPC, and London to any customer does not exceed $150 million, and (2) as a sub-limit, return of cash to any customer by London does not exceed $900,000.

View the FINRA Investor Alert for additional information. \n\nDiversification and asset allocation strategies do not ensure profit or protect against loss in declining markets. Investments in securities and other instruments involve risk and will not always be profitable including loss of principal.\n\nExchange-traded funds [ETFs] are subject to risks similar to those of other diversified portfolios. Although ETFs are designed to provide investment results that generally correspond to the performance of their respective underlying indices, they may not be able to exactly replicate the performance of the indices because of expenses and other factors. Also, there are brokerage commissions associated with trading ETFs that may negate their low management fees. ETFs are required to distribute portfolio gains to shareholders at year end. These gains may be generated by portfolio rebalancing or the need to meet diversification requirements. ETF trading will also generate tax consequences.\n\nTrading on margin involves specific risks, including the possible loss of more money than you have deposited. A decline in the value of securities that are purchased on margin may require you to provide additional funds to your trading account. In addition, E*TRADE Securities can force the sale of any securities in your account without prior notice if your equity falls below required levels, and you are not entitled to an extension of time in the event of a margin call. When trading on margin, an investor borrows a portion of the funds he/she uses to buy stocks to try to take advantage of opportunities in the market.  He/she pays interest on the funds borrowed until the loan is repaid. For each trade made in a margin account, we use all available cash and sweep funds first and then charge the customer the current margin interest rate on the balance of the funds required to fill the order. The minimum equity requirement for a margin account is $2,000. Please read more information regarding the risks of trading on margin at etrade.com/margin.\n\nE*TRADE credits and offers may be subject to U.S. withholding taxes and reporting at retail value. Taxes related to these offers are the customer's responsibility.\n\nAdaptive Portfolio utilizes a rebalancing methodology based on E*TRADE Capital Management’s portfolio allocation drift parameters. Adaptive Portfolio self-adjusts by comparing client portfolio allocations against the target allocation drift parameters each trading day after markets are closed and submitting trade orders the following trading day, when necessary, to bring the portfolio into alignment with target allocations. Out of tolerance parameters and/or rebalancing methodologies are subject to change.\n\nThe Adaptive Portfolio advisory program recommends portfolios based on answers to your Investor Profile questionnaire. You may customize your portfolio by selecting a portfolio of either ETFs or ETFs and mutual funds. If you elect to invest in a hybrid portfolio of ETFs and mutual funds, you may select a tax sensitive portfolio option. When your goals or financial situation change, you can update your Investor Profile at any time. Investor Profile updates may result in a new portfolio recommendation\n\nAutomatic Investment Plans and dollar-cost averaging do not ensure a profit and do not protect against a loss in declining markets. Investors should consider their financial ability to continue their purchases through periods of low price levels.\n\nAccount Market Value is the daily weighted average market value of assets held in the Advisory Account during the quarter after the close of business on the last trading day of the quarter. The quarters end on the last day of March, June, September and December.\n\nThe Minimum Annual Advisory Fee Credit reflects the anticipated amount of annual compensation to be received by E*TRADE Capital Management or its affiliates from funds held in the Advisory Account (or investment advisors of such fund products 1 for 12b-1, shareholder servicing, or other distribution, administration or bookkeeping fees. To the extent that the actual amount of such fees received by E*TRADE Capital Management or its affiliates exceeds the minimum credit, any such excess will be credited back to the Advisory Account.\n\nThe Maximum Annual Net Advisory Fee is the highest direct fee charges to any client in the Adaptive Program at the specified Market Value.\n\nThe Annual Advisory Fee is the direct fee charged to any client in the advisory program. Please read the E*TRADE Wrap-Fee Programs Brochure for more information about each program’s advisory fee schedule. The advisory fee does not cover underlying management fees and expenses of any mutual fund or ETF investment held in the portfolio.\n\nE*TRADE Financial Corporation and its affiliates do not provide tax advice, and nothing in this section should be construed as tax advice. Before acting on any such information, consult your own accountant or tax advisor.\n\nFor Adaptive Portfolio clients, interaction with E*TRADE Capital Management will generally be limited to the Adaptive Portfolio web-based interface. Unlike E*TRADE Capital Management’s other managed account programs, Adaptive Portfolio clients do not have an individual portfolio manager. E*TRADE Capital Management, through its Investment Policy Committee and with support of Investment Strategist, selects, removes, and adds portfolio holdings and determines the program’s rebalancing methodology.\n\nClients may visit the Adaptive Portfolio website at any time to update their investor profile information to reflect changes to their financial situation and to determine whether portfolio changes are necessary. Certain exceptions may apply, and clients will be able to consult with a team of investment adviser representatives by calling 1-866-484-3658.\n\nAssets held in an E*TRADE Securities LLC Stock Plan Account may be subject to certain sale and/or transfer restrictions and may be ineligible for the Adaptive Portfolio Program. Please consult your Stock Plan Account details for information about the eligibility of these assets for the Adaptive Portfolio Program.\n\nFinancial Consultants are dually registered with E*TRADE Securities, a registered broker-dealer, and E*TRADE Capital Management, LLC, a Registered Investment Adviser, and may offer services that are either one-time commission based or ongoing fee-based advisory services. To help determine which guidance option may be right for you, please visit etrade.com/guidance for additional information about account minimums, commissions, fees, etc.\n\nContent provided by E*TRADE Securities and/or E*TRADE Capital Management are for educational purposes only.

Funds deposited to E*TRADE Securities accounts via Transfer Money from external accounts will be available for investment or withdrawal on the third business day after the day of deposit if transferred by 4pm ET. \n\nWith Max-Rate Checking, E*TRADE Bank will not charge you a fee for withdrawing funds from any institution's ATM nationwide but the owner/operator of the ATM may. These fees will automatically be credited to your account. E*TRADE Bank does impose a charge equal to 1% of the transaction amount (including credits and reversals) for non-U.S. currency transactions. In the event E*TRADE Bank in its sole discretion determines that there has been either fraudulent or excessive use of the feature on a given account, E*TRADE Bank reserves the right to remove this feature and not refund the ATM fees. For additional information and important details about how the ATM fee refund will be applied, please visit www.etrade.com/atmrefundpolicy.\n\nPrior to investing in a managed account, E*TRADE Capital Management will obtain important information about your financial situation and risk tolerances and provide you with a detailed investment proposal, investment advisory agreement, and wrap fee programs brochure. These documents contain important information that should be read carefully before enrolling in a managed account program. Upon request, we will send you a free copy of E*TRADE Capital Management's Form ADV Part 2A, which describes, among other things, affiliations, services offered and fees charged.\n\nSecurities and futures products and services offered by E*TRADE Securities LLC, Member FINRA/SIPC/NFA.
